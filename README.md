## Overview
MarkovMate is an innovative tool designed to optimize your daily routines using the power of Markov chains. By modeling your habits, tasks, and decisions as probabilistic state transitions, MarkovMate helps identify the most efficient paths to complete everyday activities. Whether you're streamlining your morning routine, optimizing commute options, or improving productivity workflows, this project turns data-driven insights into actionable efficiency gains.
Inspired by Markov chain theory—a mathematical system where the next state depends only on the current one—MarkovMate simulates sequences of tasks to predict and suggest optimizations. It's perfect for data enthusiasts, productivity hackers, and anyone looking to shave time off repetitive daily chores.
