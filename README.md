## Overview
MarkovMate is an innovative tool designed to optimize your daily routines using the power of Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods. By intelligently sampling from the space of possible task orderings and running parallel optimization chains, MarkovMate finds superior task sequences that minimize time and maximize efficiency.

Unlike simple to-do lists or basic heuristics, MarkovMate employs sophisticated probabilistic modeling:
- **MCMC Optimization**: Explores multiple task orderings simultaneously using parallel chains to avoid local optima
- **Parallel Processing**: Runs 4-8 concurrent MCMC chains using Web Workers for faster, more comprehensive optimization
- **AI Enhancement**: Integrates Phi 3 LLM for contextual suggestions and parallel task identification
- **Smart Visualization**: Shows optimization progress, convergence metrics, and multiple solution comparisons

Whether you're streamlining your morning routine, optimizing work tasks, or improving productivity workflows, MarkovMate turns advanced probabilistic methods into actionable efficiency gains. It's perfect for data enthusiasts, productivity hackers, and anyone looking to leverage cutting-edge optimization techniques for everyday task management.
